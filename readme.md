# Blender remote render (Brr)

Brr offers a client-server approach to Blender rendering. The client side is an addon that handles connecting to the server and sending files and configurations while the server is tasked to receiving files and performing the rendering. On the server side, multiples backend can be implemented to access hardware. For now, only Slurm scheduler interface is implemented as it is commonly found on HPC systems.

Communication between the client and server is handled by Ã˜MQ messages usually going through an ssh tunnel, it is using a DEALER-ROUTER design for two way communications.  

On the server side, jobs are running Blender with a specific python script that dynamically decides which frame to render next based on what has already been rendered by other jobs.
